# Customizable Random Password-Generating Web Application

## Description

This application creates a randomly-generated password that conforms to several criteria, which user is first prompted to set in a series of window prompts & confirms. When user clicks "Generate Password" button, a window prompt appears asking user to enter desired number of characters, and console logs program initiation. Acceptable length entries range from 8 to 128, registered when user presses OK. If user enters a number outside this range or a non-numeric character, an alert message appears informing of error, error is logged in console, and program is terminated. If user presses CANCEL, a cancellation confirm message appears. Confirming this message triggers an alert of cancellation, terminates program, and logs user cancellation to console. Cancelling it returns user to previous window prompt. If a valid password length is entered, value is logged to console, and next four confirm windows ask user if they want to include or exclude the following character types: numbers, special characters, and upper- and lowercase letters. Each user-choice is logged to console. Once all criteria are set, a confirm window asks user if they wish to proceed with password generation. Pressing CANCEL leads to another cancellation confirm message. Confirming this message triggers alert of cancellation, terminates program, and logs user cancellation to console. Cancelling it returns user to previous window confirm. If user confirms this message, password is generated and displayed in center of webpage, and additional functionality data is logged to console. This data demonstrates random character-selecting mechanism according to user-defined parameters, reports final program output, and marks end of program.

## Usage

Nav bar links provide instant navigation to a desired section, and are always visible at the top of the screen in a fixed position. These elements will conform to a narrower screen size in column form. Screenshots of various deployed projects contained overlaid text descriptions and are clickable as hyperlinks to each project. These elements also automatically conform to differing screen sizes. "Email Me" link opens users email client with a blank draft addressed to me.
