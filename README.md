# Customizable Random Password-Generating Web Application

## Description

This application creates a randomly-generated password that conforms to several criteria, which user is first prompted to set in a series of window prompts & confirms. When user clicks "Generate Password" button, a window prompt appears asking user to enter desired number of characters, and console logs program initiation. Acceptable length entries range from 8 to 128, registered when user presses OK. If user enters a number outside this range or a non-numeric character, an alert message appears informing of error, and program is terminated. If user presses CANCEL, a cancellation confirm message appears giving choice to terminate program or return to previous window prompt. If a valid password-length input is entered, value is logged to console, and next four confirm windows ask user if they want to include or exclude the following character types: numbers, special characters, and upper- and lowercase letters. Each user-choice is logged to console. Once all criteria are set, a confirm window asks user if they wish to proceed with password generation. Pressing CANCEL leads to another cancellation confirm message with choice to terminate program or return to previous window confirm.

## Usage

Nav bar links provide instant navigation to a desired section, and are always visible at the top of the screen in a fixed position. These elements will conform to a narrower screen size in column form. Screenshots of various deployed projects contained overlaid text descriptions and are clickable as hyperlinks to each project. These elements also automatically conform to differing screen sizes. "Email Me" link opens users email client with a blank draft addressed to me.
